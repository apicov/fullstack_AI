# ðŸš€ AI Learning Project Roadmap: Your Journey to Mastery

## ðŸŽ¯ Introduction: Building Your Way to AI Mastery

This roadmap shows you exactly what projects to build at each stage of your learning journey. Each project integrates multiple technologies and builds upon previous knowledge.

### Learning Approach

The roadmap follows a parallel learning methodology where you study JavaScript, React, TinyML, and LLMs simultaneously. This approach helps you understand how modern AI systems work as integrated platforms rather than isolated components.

Each week builds upon previous concepts while introducing new complexity in a structured way.
