# Fullstack AI Learning Course

Welcome to the **Fullstack AI Learning Course**!  
This repository contains a set of tutorials and resources for learning modern AI development, covering web technologies, machine learning, and IoT systems.

## About This Course

This course provides a learning path that covers multiple interconnected technologies:
- Modern JavaScript development and async programming
- React frontend development and state management
- TinyML and edge AI deployment
- Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI agents
- IoT systems and real-time video processing

The tutorials are designed to be studied in parallel, allowing you to understand how these technologies work together in modern AI applications.

## Learning Approach

Instead of learning each technology separately, this course uses a parallel learning approach where you study JavaScript, React, TinyML, and LLMs simultaneously. This helps you understand how modern AI systems integrate multiple technologies and see patterns across different domains.

Each week introduces concepts across all areas while building upon previous knowledge through hands-on projects.
